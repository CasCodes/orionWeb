# orionWeb
Website of the Orion development group

Installation:
1. Open a text editor and terminal (or the internal terminal in vscode)
2. run ``` npm init @vitejs/app ``` and just press tab when it asks you something (we'll use vanilla js)
3. run ``` npm install three ``` 
4. run ``` npm run dev ``` (if that doesn't work, run ``` npm install``` and then try again)
5. Now download the repo and replace style.css ,  index.html and main.js with the once of the repo, as well as add the remaining files.
6. At this point you can go to localhost:3000 in your browser and should see the site. If not, give up and cry.
